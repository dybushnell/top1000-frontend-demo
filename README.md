## About CancelComedians.com

Every year since 2014, Zach Broussard (@ZachBroussard) has compiled a list of the top 1000 comedians in America. CancelComedians.com is his list for 2019. CancelComedians.com was launched on December 16, 2019, and was interactive until December 20, 2019, at which point the list was locked and the funcationality removed from the site.

## About this repository

This repository represents a functional demo implementation of CancelComedians.com. The reason for this is twofold: it allows current visitors to interact with the site as it was in its brief life; and it prevents visitors from seeing some of the code and comments which have not been expressly released by Mr. Broussard and thus are deemed to be confidential. The repository of the original CancelComedians.com is marked as private on Github. 

## Technology

The front end for CancelComedians.com was written in React for its ability quickly render pages. CancelCoemdians.com also makes use of the React Router library.
